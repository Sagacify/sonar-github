# SonarQube GitHub Plugin

As stated below the title, this is a fork from [SonarSource/sonar-github](https://github.com/Sagacify/sonar-github).
This branch is REBASED onto the upstream branch instead of using merge. So any pull-request on a feature we have added should be made on the feature branch instead of this one.

## Changes added:
* Make github token a global setting settable in the web interface
* Add a severity level setting settable in the web interface or per-project.
