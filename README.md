# SonarQube GitHub Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SonarSource/sonar-github.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SonarSource/sonar-github)

This branch makes the github token settable in the web interface.
Be careful as a side effect is that it makes it visible using sonar's api and is therefore a security risk if allowing unconnected connections.
